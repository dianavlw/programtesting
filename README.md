# programtesting weird name I know I guess I changed my mind along the way about what this would really be about

anywho this repo contains chapters from Cracking the Code Interview by Gayle Laakmann as 
well as small unfinished projects. 

I did followed a few Python Testing Tutorial by Corey Schafer, being the reason to this repo but was held back to algo and structure studying.

Feel free to also follow along by viewing his youtube tutorial Python Tutorial: Unit Testing your Code with unittest Module.
If you would like to know more, you can also follow along on his github.
